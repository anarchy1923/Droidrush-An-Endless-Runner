# Droidrush-An-Endless-Runner
This is my project for the odd semester for my Undergrad, and it is an endless runner game I created under the guidance of my mentor Ms. Rubal Jeet. It has several levels, and encompasses a  scoring system as well. Explore the game and fall in love with its easy going retro aesthetics.
