# Droidrush-An-Endless-Runner
This is my project for the odd semester for my Undergrad, and it is an endless runner game I created using Unity Game Engine. I've coded the game in C Sharp, and it implements a scoring system, a random platform spawner with the complexity of the platforms increasing as we go. It also includes a collision system, along with some pickup assets which i created using blender. The car model has also been created in blender. The app also implements a level system, albeit not polished enough and might get things going
