# Droidrush-An-Endless-Runner
 This is my project for the odd semester for my Undergrad, and it is an endless runner game I created using Unity Game Engine. I've coded the game in C Sharp, and it implements a scoring system, a random platform spawner with the complexity of the platforms increasing as we go. It also includes a collision system, along with some pickup assets which i created using blender. The car model has also been created in blender. The app also implements a level system, albeit not polished enough and might get things going


 ●	It is an endless 3d racer game with level system, a scoring system.
 ●	The game implements 3D models to its core, and I have applied physics to the game assets
 ●	It includes the PlatformSpawner script, a CarController Script, CarManager scripts which allow to control various aspects of the project.
 ●	Coding has been implemented in C#, and the game engine used is Unity Game Engine, and the 3d models have been created in Blender. 
 ●	It also includes the first menu screen, and a High Score Implementation system, which stores the score, each time the app closes.
 ●	Game is live on the Amazon Appstore as “Droidrush: An Endless Racer
